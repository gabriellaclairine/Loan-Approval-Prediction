## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gabriellaclairine/Loan-Approval-Prediction.git
    cd Loan-Approval-Prediction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing all necessary packages like streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, etc.)*

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will now be running on your local server!
